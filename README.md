# iFood-Marketing-Analysis


<h2>Description</h2>
iFood's recent marketing initiative in the United States have encountered significant challenges, resulting in a modest 15% response rate.  To address these challenges, we are strategically shifting towards a data-driven model to help target the correct customers for our future marketing campaigns.  Throughout our analysis in python, using pandas and seaborn, we found that customer engagement was much higher in previous respondents of the campaign and in certain age and family demographics.
